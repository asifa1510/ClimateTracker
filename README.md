**Climate Impact Tracker** 🌱

An open-source AI agent that estimates the carbon impact of digital activity and suggests practical ways to reduce it.

**Overview**
Climate Impact Tracker helps developers understand the environmental cost of cloud usage and web activity.  
It turns everyday technical decisions into **transparent CO₂e estimates** and **actionable improvements**.

**What it does**
- Estimates carbon impact from cloud and web activity  
- Identifies the largest emission drivers  
- Recommends low-effort, high-impact optimizations  
- Tracks progress over time 📉

**How it works**
Collect usage data → estimate CO₂e → analyze → suggest improvements

All results are *directional estimates*, not precise measurements.  
Methods and assumptions are documented and open.

**Tech stack**
- n8n (self-hosted)
- PostgreSQL
- Open-source carbon estimation models
- Local or hosted LLM for analysis
