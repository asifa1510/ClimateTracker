# Climate Impact Tracker

An open-source AI agent that estimates the carbon impact of digital activity and suggests practical ways to reduce it.

## What it does
- Estimates CO₂e from cloud usage and web activity  
- Highlights main emission drivers  
- Recommends low-effort, high-impact improvements  
- Tracks changes over time

## Why
Digital emissions are real but invisible.  
This project makes them visible — transparently and for free.

## How it works
Data → CO₂e estimates → AI suggestions → weekly report

All numbers are **estimates**, with clear assumptions.
